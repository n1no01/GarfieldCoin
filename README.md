GarfieldCoin is a memetoken built on the Internet Computer (ICP), featuring an interactive official website and a full-stack competitive arcade game. Every week, players battle for the highest score, and the top performer is recorded permanently as the Weekly Winner.

🎮 The Game

A fast, one-minute arcade challenge where:

- Food and bomb items fall from the top of the screen
- You control Garfield, moving horizontally to collect items
- Catch food to gain points
- Catch a bomb and you lose points, so accuracy matters
- Each round lasts exactly 60 seconds

After your time is up, your score is submitted to the global leaderboard.

The game is optimized for both PC and mobile, though it tends to be slightly easier to achieve higher scores on mobile thanks to more responsive touch control.

🏆 Weekly Winner System

Every week resets with a clean slate. Throughout the week:

- All submitted high scores compete for the top position
- The highest score of the week is stored
- The winner’s wallet/player data is recorded
- A history of previous weekly champions is maintained

This gives players a recurring incentive to come back and claim the throne.

🌐 ICP-Powered Full Stack

The website, game backend, scoring system, and weekly winner tracking all run on ICP canisters, providing:

- High performance
- Low compute cost
- On-chain persistence of winners
- A transparent and decentralized backend
